## Current Status

We are currently designing the EBNF for our language and swapping ideals on how it should be expressed to the users. 
Over break we would like to implement a parser for the language and see if we can get the locations  for network calls to be inserted into the code. 
After the calls are inserted we will have a simple compiler to drop it into javascript. Our language is more restrictive than javascript so code transformation should be fairly trivial. 


## Current struggles
Figuring out how to interface to js is a chellenge. We currently plan on not allowing to have functions written in js, but that was an idea that was thrown around.
We also don't know how we should interact with the DOM yet. We'll keep working on those.
