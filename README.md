# Compiler Construction Project

This repository is for a final project in CSCI 4555 Compiler Construction at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Marmalum is a novel programming language that abstracts away network calls (for a full description, read the paper linked below).

The compiler is written in Scala and can be run using the Scala Build Tool. The project root is in the _compilamum/_ directory. An example Marmalum source file can be found in the _examples/_ directory.
